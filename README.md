# Smart Offline Biometric EVM using Raspberry Pi

## 🔍 Overview
This project solves the problem of fake or duplicate voting in rural areas where internet is limited or unavailable. Using Raspberry Pi, fingerprint and face recognition, and RFID-based authentication, we ensure a secure and offline voting experience.

## 🎯 Features
- Offline voting system
- Biometric (Fingerprint & Face) authentication
- RFID-based voter ID check
- Time-restricted voting
- Local storage of voting data

## 🛠️ Components Used
- Raspberry Pi
- Fingerprint Sensor
- Face Recognition Camera (e.g., PiCam)
- RFID Reader + Tags
- Touchscreen Display
- MicroSD Card
- Power Supply

## 📁 Project Structure
- `code/`: Python scripts for each module
- `hardware/`: Circuit diagrams and BOM
- `ppt/`: Final presentation slides
- `data/`: Sample data and local database format

## 🧠 How it Works
1. Voter scans fingerprint or face and RFID card.
2. System checks if the voter has already voted.
3. If valid, the voter selects their candidate.
4. Vote is saved to local memory (JSON or CSV).
5. Voting is only allowed during scheduled hours.

## ✅ Advantages
- Prevents duplicate/fake voting
- Works without internet
- Easy to use touchscreen
- Tamper-resistant via biometrics

## 📷 Demo
_Images and videos will be added soon._
